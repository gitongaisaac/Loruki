I made this website for the purposes of sharpenig my HTML and CSS skills.

## Covered Topics

This website covers some major topics such as:

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- HTML forms

This project features no CSS frameworks or anything, it is pure CSS, it neither covers any other languages, just HTML and CSS. The project is a custom of the original one that was created by Brad in his YouTube channel.

It is fully responsive and after i deploy it to netlify i will attach the link.
