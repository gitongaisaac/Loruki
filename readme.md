I made this website for the purposes of practising HTML and CSS.

I created this website 3 times; the first time i copy pasted what i saw in the tutorial, the second time i could watch a page and then recreate it without checking only to go back and check what i did wrong and how i should have done it, by the time i was done creating it for the second time, i had googled alot of CSS and by this time my CSS and HTML was good.

After the second time I noticed that some things were a repetition and so i decided to creat my global styles; the main CSS file, you can find it in my repositories. After creating my main CSS file i applied the styles on the website but it was alot of work and so i decided to create another website and this is it. The third time just created it without referring from the tutorial since i was pretty good at what i was doing.

## Covered Topics

This website covers some major topics such as:

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- HTML forms

This project features no CSS frameworks or anything, it is pure CSS, it neither covers any other languages, just HTML and CSS. The project is a custom of the original one that was created by Brad in his YouTube channel.

It is fully responsive and after i deploy it to netlify i will attach the link.
